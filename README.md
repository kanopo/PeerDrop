## Guide
1. Both the two users should go to [PeerDrop](https://p2p.kanopo.org)
2. User **A** go to p2p/send and user **B** go to p2p/recive
3. User **B**(the reciver) send his identity code to user **A**
4. User **A** select the correct ID from his dropdown menu(if the ID isn't there, press the refresh button)
5. After user **A** has selected and started the connection with user **B** the p2p connection is established.
6. After the connection, user **A** can pick a file from his file system and send it to user **B** 

## 	Involved technology
PeerDrop is a "*web app*" built using:
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)
- [SocketIO](https://socket.io/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn)
- [Nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)


## The idea
I really love the AirDrop features from Apple, but that functionality have some limitations:
- devices need to be physically close
- work only with Apple devices

AirDrop can send huge file without noticeable compression by the final user.


Other alternative for sending file to other people are:
- if you are close
  - USB stick
- if you are far away:
  - small file
    - mail
    - Telegram
    - WhatsApp
  - big file
    - upload on Google Drive or similar
    - seeding a torrent or similar


The features this projects has:
- simple UI
- large availability in terms of devices supported(WebRTC support lots of devices)
- fast sending and receiving process(Cloud storage frequently have band limitations)


## NAT

![ivrpowers-turn-stun-screen 005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101810067/167648785-4202639f-534b-40aa-840e-c9218140a007.jpeg)

Some users try to connect through different IP networks where Firewalls and NATs (Network Address Translators) could include specific policies that do not allow any kind of RTC communications.

### STUN
Sometimes, you can use a protocol called STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) that allows clients to discover their public IP address and the type of NAT they are behind.

### TURN
However, even if the STUN server is properly set up, there are very restrictive corporate networks (e.g: UDP traffic forbidden, only 443 TCP allowed…), which will require clients to use a TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server to relay traffic if direct (peer to Video Gateway) connection fails.



### Coturn
For the networking around NATs I choose an open source project called Coturn with a simple configuration file:

```
# /etc/turnserver.conf

listening-port=3478

fingerprint

lt-cred-mech

server-name=coturn.kanopo.org

realm=coturn.kanopo.org

user=dmodmo:password

total-quota=100

stale-nonce=600
```

## Backend

PeerJS has a included signaling server, a service that allow peers to find each others and establish a connection.

I preferred using an express server for signaling with socket.io, this way the sender peer can have a list of the online users and avoiding copy and pasting the UUID.

### Docker
The backend express server was deployed using docker and docker-compose(the config is in the backend directory).

## Frontend 
The frontend is a simple multipage react app where the CSS part was done with tailwind CSS library and some animations are done with motion library by framer.

## PeerJS

PeerJS is a library that wrap WebRTC protocol allowing the use of peer-to-peer connections in the browser.

## Deployment
The final step was to deploy on a VPS the web app, I usually chose nginx for this part because makes the routing and hosting multiple page on the same VPS really easy.

The web app is currently online at [my website](https://p2p.kanopo.org).
